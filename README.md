# RANDOM-FOREST-HYPER-PARAMETER-TUNING

This is my attempt at understanding the different hyper-parameters present in the Random Forest Algorithm. 

I have included a description of most of the hyper-parameters according to my own understanding (&research) and how they can be tuned to enhance the model

For this project i used R language in Jupyter Notebook

I worked with the Churn dataset in R. This dataset can be found in the C50 Library
